# TwoStringSum
This web app is used to find the total of two strings as integers. It will prompt the users two almost infinity strings as integers and then find the addition of them in the order from right to left .

Programming languages: Java, JavaScript, Html/Css
The technologies I have used: SpringBoot, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap. Applied Ajax so it does not need to reload the page for the result.
